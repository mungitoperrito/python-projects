Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 â€“ March 15, 1937), a prolific and problematic
writer, is often considered one of the greatest authors of early American horror, sciencefiction, and "weird" fiction. His stories echo such great horror and fantasy authors as Poe,
Dunsany, and Chambers. But Lovecraft also brought to his writing a "cosmic horror," which
sprang out of his fantasies and nightmares.
The Complete Works of H.P. Lovecraft contains all Lovecraft's solo writings as an adult,
beginning in 1917 with "The Tomb" and ending in 1935 with "The Haunter of the Dark." His
collaborative works and revisions are not included.
